SDLE First Assignment of group T06G14.

Reliable PUB-SUB messaging library for RUST. Provides Broker implementation and functions to use in clients and publishers.

The project is structured in three sub-projects. A library called meic_mq. A client that has some test scenarios and the broker.

## Dependencies [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
We recommend installing Rust by following the official guide that can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). Addicionally our project depends on ZeroMQ because our library is actually a binding to the C implementation and on pkg-config. We only tested our program under Ubuntu and Ubuntu under WSL2.

### How to install ZeroMQ

**ZeroMQ** can be installed with the following command:

```
apt install libzmq3-dev
```

### How to install pkg-config
**pkg-config** can be installed with the following command:

```
apt install pkg-config
```

## How to compile and run our program
Our program uses the [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) as package manager and build system

### Running broker
The following commands assume the user is inside the broker folder.

The broker can be compiled with the following command:

```
cargo build
```

The broker can be ran with the following command (that also compiles the program):

```
cargo run
```

### Running client
The following commands assume the user is inside the client folder.

The client can be compiled with the following command:

```
cargo build
```

The client has three test scenarios. One called slow subscriber that tries to emulate the scenario where a subscriber is behind other subscriber and the broker needs to wait for the slowest one to be able to delete messages. The second one is called late subscriber and tries to replicate the scenario where a subscriber subscribes a topic when a topic already has messages. The last one is called concurrency and tries to emulate concurent reads on multiple topics. This scenario is divided in four parts: cars publisher, biology publisher, cars subscriber and biology subscriber. Each publisher and subscriber try to send request with a 500 millisecond interval so that we can maximize concurrency between get and put requests. 

### Running the slow subscriber scenario

```
cargo run -- slow_sub
```

### Running the late subscriber

```
cargo run -- late_sub
```

### Running the concurrency scenario

#### Running the biology publisher
```
cargo run -- conc_pub_bio [publisher id]
```

#### Running the cars publisher
```
cargo run -- conc_pub_cars [publisher id]
```

#### Running the biology subscriber
```
cargo run -- conc_sub_bio [subscriber id]
```

#### Running the cars subscriber
```
cargo run -- conc_sub_cars [subscriber id]
```
